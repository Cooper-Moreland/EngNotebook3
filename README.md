# CircuitPython

## LedGlow

### Description

The goal of this assignment was to make the neopixel led on the Metro M4 to glow red (I chose purple), if you put hte code in the regular way it glows blue so you have to
download the neopixel file into your CircuitPython file to make it work.

### Code

### Image/Wiring

No wiring needed (led is already on the board)

### Reflection

use "import" to import stuff mainly neopixel to include the led on the board.

## Servo

### Description

The goal of this assignment was to make a servo rotate between 0 and 180 degrees. The servo can be connected to any one of the D pins on the board.

### Reflection

You must import files you need in your code from the circuit python library.

## DistanceSensor

### Description

The goal of this assignment was to have the neopixel on the board fade between colors based on how far away it is from any given object (red for closest, green for farthest away).

### Image/Wiring

### Reflection

Ultrasonic sensor wire placements are different on the M4, you use pins like D2 and D3 as shown in the code. [Link to help with how to use simpleio](https://docs.circuitpython.org/projects/simpleio/en/latest/api.html)

# AdvancedCAD

## Launcher

### Description

Make a launcher with a partner with each of you doing different parts and assembling together. Mates used to show how the key will affect the spinner.

### Reflection

Versions are the history of your document and branches are your personal sandbox to use as a testing ground without ruining the current build.

## SwingArm

### Description

Create a build based on an image and a few given dimensions. After the build is done you'll use the variables to change the size and shape of your build how the instructions tell you. Hopefully you dimensioned things right!

### Reflection

Pay full attention to the full build picture so you dont miss any parts of the build, and keep in mind you have to change values so you want that to affect the build the intended way (such as distancing a circle 5mm from another circle instead of just putting the total value.)

## Multi-PartStudio

### Description

The swing arm but on steroids, it doesn't give you a part to create first so it's your job to figure out the best one. You make all the parts in the same part studio which is what differs from the swing arm since that didn't really have separate parts.

### Reflection

Start with the bottom cap because it's basically the base and the top cap is a more complicated copy of it. If doing this again, make sure to find the easiest starting part and pay attention to how you dimension things off of each other with the changes in mind.
