## LedGlow

### Description

The goal of this assignment was to make the neopixel led on the Metro M4 to glow red (I chose purple), if you put hte code in the regular way it glows blue so you have to
download the neopixel file into your CircuitPython file to make it work.

### Code

### Image/Wiring

No wiring needed (led is already on the board)

### Reflection

use "import" to import stuff mainly neopixel to include the led on the board.

## Distance Sensor

### Description

The goal of this assignment was to have the neopixel on the board fade between colors based on how far away it is from any given object (red for closest, green for farthest away).

### Image/Wiring

### Reflection

I learned how to use simpleio in my code to more effectively give ranges for conditions. I also got better at using "if" conditions in my coding.
