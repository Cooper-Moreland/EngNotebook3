## Led Glow

### Description

The goal of this assignment was to make the neopixel led on the Metro M4 to glow red (I chose purple), if you put hte code in the regular way it glows blue so you have to
download the neopixel file into your CircuitPython file to make it work.

### Code

### Image/Wiring

No wiring needed (led is already on the board)

### Reflection

use "import" to import stuff mainly neopixel to include the led on the board.
